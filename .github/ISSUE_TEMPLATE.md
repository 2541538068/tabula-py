# Before reporting an issue

For general programming questions with `tabula-py`, please ask on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) instead.

Look at the [FAQ](https://github.com/chezou/tabula-py#faq) and previous issues whethere your issue is already reported.

Please comply following issue template with your bug report. Since tabula-py is a personal project of chezou and my resource is limited, I can't support all general programming questions such as "How to set PATH to java command on Windows?". If you can't follow this issue template, I have no choice but to close the issue.
